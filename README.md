# Langchain

Langchain is a framework that helps in building applications with large language models by providing tools and components to manage the interaction between the models and data.
Developed RAG Q&A application with multiple data sources as arxiv,wikipedia,and others using `agents.ipynb`. Also built Q&A chatbot with multiple pdf files using `google_gemma`. Gemma is a lightweight, open source LLM models built from the research and technology that google used to create the `Gemini` models. Then developed various text summarization techniques utilizing the Langchain framework in `Text summarization`. These techniques are designed to efficiently condense large texts into concise summaries while retaining the essential information.
